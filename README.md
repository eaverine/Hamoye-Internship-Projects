# Hamoye-Internship-Projects
This covers the projects and assignments taken and completed during my data science internship at Hamoye AI.  

Stage A is basically an introduction to Python for Machine Learning with the main project utilising fuel quality data from  
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(United States Energy Information Administration).

Stage B is an introduction to regression, with primary focus on linear regression and regularization techniques, such as the  
linear, ridge and lasso methods. The main project utilized Appliances Energy Prediction data for a location in Belgium.
