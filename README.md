# Hamoye-Internship-Projects
This covers the projects and assignments taken and completed during my data science internship at Hamoye AI.  

Stage A is basically an introduction to Python for Machine Learning with the main project utilising fuel quality data  
from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(United States Energy Information Administration).

Stage B is an introduction to regression, with primary focus on linear regression and regularization techniques, such  
as the linear, ridge and lasso methods. The main project utilized Appliances Energy Prediction data for a location in Belgium.

 Stage C covers classification under Machine Learning, with topics such as Linear Classification and Logistic Regression,  
 Measuring Classification Performance, Multiclass Classification, Tree-Based Methods, Support Vector Machine and
 Ensemble Methods. The main project was 'Classification - Managing the Quality Metric of Global Ecological Footprint', using  
 data from the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts.  **[Ecological Footprint per capita data](https://query.data.world/s/wh6j7rxy2hvrn4ml75ci62apk5hgae)**
